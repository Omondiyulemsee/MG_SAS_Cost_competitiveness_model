This documentation describes the code that is used to evaluate the cost competitiveness 
between solar plus battery powered mini-grids(MG) and Standalone systems (SAS) powering a 
rural village. The code sizes for different solar PV plus battery capacity combinations that meet 
the annual electricity demand for different loads, and optimizes for the least cost system that 
meets the Loss of Energy Probability (LOEP) over the project lifetime.

All instructions on how to install and use the model are included in the document: off-grid_cost_competitiveness_model_documentation.pdf
